# 🩺 MediConnect – Your Smart Medical Management App

> A full-stack Health Management platform where **patients and doctors connect seamlessly**. Built with ❤️ using **Flutter**, **Spring Boot**, **Firebase**, and **MySQL**.

## 🚀 Overview

**MediConnect** is a modern mobile solution for managing medical appointments, enabling patients to:

- 🔍 Browse doctors by specialization  
- 📅 Book and manage appointments  
- 💬 Chat securely with doctors  
- 📁 Download test results and X-rays  
- 📲 Receive real-time notifications  

Meanwhile, doctors can:

- 🧑‍⚕️ Manage their schedule and availability  
- 📄 View patient histories and files  
- 📷 Upload their profile photos  
- 🗨️ Communicate with patients in-app  

This was my **graduation project**, and I built the **mobile app from scratch** using Flutter. My teammates built the React web for doctors, and handled and backend using spring boot, and we worked together on firebase together.
